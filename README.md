# Travel-Advisor

The Trip Adviser Agent (TAA) asks for various necessary information from the traveler in
order to formulate and generate the appropriate advice and guidelines for the traveler given their
situation. The TAA specifically specializes in the rules and regulations provided by the New Zealand
governing body. The TAA can generate guidelines for various types of travelers like citizens,
non-citizens, dependents, students, and other necessary work-related travelers. Given the current
situation under the global pandemic, a system or machine like the Trip Advisor Agent is incredibly
helpful for travelers since there are a plethora of new rules and regulations concerning health and
safety protocols and stricter ever-changing border rules. Some travelers may be too daunted or
intimidated by such a vast amount of information needed to attain for them to book flights, thus
something like the TAA can alleviate their concerns by simplifying the research process for the
traveler with its extensive knowledge on the current rules and regulations provided by the
government.
